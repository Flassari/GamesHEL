						A year after its release, Game Director Harry Krueger reflects on the unique development of Nex Machina: how the project started as a modern love letter to the arcade, what it was like to collaborate with arcade legend and inspiration Eugene Jarvis, and what challenges and lessons the team faced as they set out to create a modern arcade classic. The presentation will also explore the creative philosophy behind the game, and dive into some of the key design decisions that shaped Housemarque's most critically acclaimed title to date.
					</p>
					<p class="speaker_description"><span class="speake_bio_title">Speaker bio:</span> Born in Australia, and raised in Greece, Harry always had a passion for gaming. Growing up in the 80s and 90s, Harry spent countless hours (and quarters) at the arcades which largely shaped his creative sensibilities, and inspired him to make games himself one day.
					Starting his career as a programmer with an undying passion for game design, Harry's appreciation of classic gameplay values made him a perfect fit for Housemarque, where he has played his part part in keeping the arcade spirit alive for the past 10 years.
					<br/><br/>
					In recent years, he acted as Lead Programmer for the award-winning PS4 shoot'em up Resogun, and later went on to direct its two expansions, Heroes and Defenders. He made his debut as Game Director with the critically acclaimed Nex Machina, which was made in collaboration with arcade legend and inspiration Eugene Jarvis.
					<br/><br/>
					Currently Harry is acting as Game Director for Housemarque's top-secret, unannounced AAA Project.</p>
