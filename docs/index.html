							In his talk "Keeping CONTROL" at Games Helsinki 2019, Juha talked about the challenges of a full-scale high-profile AAA production. That was about 7 months before actually shipping Control. "Staying in Control" picks up right where the 2019 talk left off, kicking off with insights on the actual shipping of the game, followed by what has happened in the Control Franchise during the years after. Juha will also highlight some of the not so obvious production tools that have been useful during and after Control.

							Juha Vainio is an Executive Producer and the Head of the Control Franchise at Remedy Entertainment. He has over twenty years of management experience in software development and over ten years of production experience in the games industry. As the head of the Control Franchise he is currently e.g. overseeing the development of two Control projects. On the original Control he was the Lead Producer heading the production and shipping the game. At Rovio he worked on big mobile titles such as the original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Star Wars, and as the CEO of Epic Owl he shipped the still-profitable free-to-play mobile game Space Arena: Build and Fight with virtually no budget.

							Housemarque is the oldest game development studio in Finland, known mostly for their fast-paced arcade-inspired shooters. With Returnal, they had a unique opportunity to take their craft to the next level and create a world-class launch title for the PS5. This retrospective-style talk will cover Housemarque's full "indie to AAA" journey of developing Returnal, from the initial concept and aspirations to its eventual critically-acclaimed release.<br/><br/>

							The talk will delve deeper into some key creative decisions and challenges the team overcame as they shot for the stars with Returnal: from transitioning their trademark neon-fused arcade action to a 3rd person experience; to building roguelite/procedurally generated worlds; to integrating a layered and haunting narrative, all for the first time, and all done while adapting to a rapidly growing team, a new platform, a relatively unfamiliar engine (Unreal 4), and in the end even shipping amidst a global pandemic.
						</p>
						<p class="speaker_description"><span class="speake_bio_title">Speaker bio:</span>
							Starting his career as a gameplay coder with an undying passion for game design, Harry's appreciation of arcade games and timeless gameplay values made him a perfect fit for Housemarque. Over the last 14 years, Harry has played a central part in defining the studio's explosive, bullet-hell inspired creative identity. During that time, he has acted as Lead Programmer for the award-winning PS4 launch title Resogun, and later went on to direct its two expansions: Heroes and Defenders. He made his debut as Game Director with the explosive shooter Nex Machina, which became the studio's most critically acclaimed title to date, and the development of which was immortalized in the documentary "The Name of the Game".<br/><br/>

							Recently, Harry acted as Game Director of Returnal - Housemarque's first foray into the big leagues, and the studio's largest and most ambitious project ever. Returnal went on to receive multiple awards and 4 BAFTAs (including that of Best Game) and received widespread critical acclaim from reviews and players alike. As a result, Housemarque ended up joining the Playstation Studios family in 2021, where Harry continues to lead the studio's creative direction to this day.
