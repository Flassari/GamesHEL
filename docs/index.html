						<p class="program_description">
							The shapes of stories are all around us and games love to use heroic plots. When making The Gardens Between, we asked: how do we make game where the hero work is unlearning, letting go, and taking the time to enjoy the time we have? We searched for the shape of our story and though we found another iconic story structure, our work was only partly done.
							<br/><br/>
							This talk will discuss how a narrative designer executes a story when the core gameplay, observational and free of time pressures, it is seemingly at odds with storytelling language such as conflict and drama. It will also consider how to communicate story to the development team and to the player for this adventure puzzle game with no text or dialogue. Doing so requires the narrative designer to act as a conduit of communication in order to tell the story to players by bridging the gap between game design imperatives and narrative themes.

							A year after its release, Harry Krueger reflects on the unique development of <i>Nex Machina</i>: how the project started as a modern love letter to the arcade, what it was like to collaborate with arcade legend and inspiration Eugene Jarvis, and what challenges and lessons the team faced as they set out to create a modern arcade classic. The presentation will also explore the creative philosophy behind the game, and dive into some of the key design decisions that shaped Housemarque's most critically acclaimed title to date.
						</p>
						<p class="speaker_description"><span class="speake_bio_title">Speaker bio:</span>
							Born in Australia, and raised in Greece, Harry always had a passion for gaming. Growing up in the 80s and 90s, Harry spent countless hours (and quarters) at the arcades which largely shaped his creative sensibilities, and inspired him to make games himself one day. Starting his career as a programmer with an undying passion for game design, Harry's appreciation of classic gameplay values made him a perfect fit for Housemarque, where he has played his part in keeping the arcade spirit alive for the past 10 years.
							<br/><br/>In recent years, he acted as Lead Programmer for PS4 shoot'em up <i>Resogun</i>, and later went on to direct its two expansions, <i>Heroes</i> and <i>Defenders</i>. He made his debut as Game Director with the critically acclaimed <i>Nex Machina</i>.
							<br/><br/>Currently Harry is working on Housemarque's top-secret, unannounced AAA Project.
